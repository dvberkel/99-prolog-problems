# 99 Prolog Problems
Attempt to solve the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems.

## Prolog Site
Over at the [Prolog site][site] there is a recreation of
the [99 Prolog Problems][problems]. The purpose of this problem collection is

> to give you the opportunity to practice your skills in logic programming. Your
> goal should be to find the most elegant solution of the given problems.
> Efficiency is important, but logical clarity is even more crucial. Some of the
> (easy) problems can be trivially solved using built-in predicates. However, in
> these cases, you learn more if you try to find your own solution. 

The problem collection is subdivided in sections. To each section a directory is
devoted. In each section a file per problem can be found.
